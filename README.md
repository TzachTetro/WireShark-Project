# WireShark-Project

## Description

This project introduces to Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer used for capturing and inspecting data packets in real-time. The project covers basic network security analysis techniques, helping users understand network traffic, identify potential security threats, and diagnose common network issues.

## Features

- **Packet Capture**: Learn how to capture network traffic using Wireshark.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Understand and analyze different network protocols.
- **Traffic Filtering**: Use filters to focus on specific types of traffic or conversations.
- **Packet Inspection**: Inspect individual data packets for detailed information.
- **Traffic Visualization**: Visualize network traffic patterns and statistics.
- **Save and Export**: Save captured data and export it for further analysis.
- **Basic Security Analysis**: Identify common signs of network intrusions or suspicious activities.
- **Network Diagnostics**: Diagnose network issues such as latency, packet loss, and misconfigurations.

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
The project begins with capturing network traffic using Wireshark, where users learn to initiate and stop packet captures. Next, users explore filtering options to isolate specific types of traffic, such as HTTP or DNS requests, making it easier to focus on relevant data. The walk-through includes detailed packet inspection, teaching users how to analyze packet details and understand protocol structures. Finally, the project covers basic network security analysis, where users identify potential threats and anomalies within the captured data.
